# Royal-Estates
This is a project I've made for my Mobile Apps with open source technologies course. It is an app that is connected to a Firebase db and holds the data of different estates. The user can choose a location and browse the estates in that location. When an estate is clicked he can see a detailed information with cards, a Map page with Angular 2 Google Maps and similar estates. The user can save the estates as favorites and remove them.
